# How to Contribute

## 1. Create a new branch following this naming scheme:
- Feature - Add new functionality to the program
- Fix - Remove a bug or other issue, but keep the functionality the same
- Other -  Does not fit into another category

Example: `Feature-AddLoginPage` or `Fix-LoginPageBug`

## 2. Make the change
Write the code to add the feature or fix the bug in your new branch and test it to the best of your ability.

## 3. Make sure your branch is up to date with `Main` 
Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/BradyHodge/projectArgus), click on the "Branches" tab.
